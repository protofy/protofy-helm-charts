Keycloak should now be available under {{ include "keycloak.externalUrl" . }}
You can log in as '{{ .Values.admin.username }}' with the password you passed under admin.password
It is good practice to create a new realm and not use 'master'. There are multiple ways to do this:
- Manually: Click on the dropdown in the top left corner and select "Add realm"
- via Public Terraform Provider: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mrparkers/keycloak/latest/docs/resources/realm
- via opinionated Protofy Ops Terraform Module: https://github.com/protofy/terraform-kubernetes/tree/keycloak/keycloak/keycloak_realm
